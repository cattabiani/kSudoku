### KSudoku

This is just a small test program to generate sudokus. The aim is neither to solve them nor to distribute the hidden squares. Here I just want to generate a 9x9 matrix of numbers that respects the sudoku rules. 

# Method employed

I am using a minheap and an ultra-greedy approach. The important function is `Board::rand()`.
